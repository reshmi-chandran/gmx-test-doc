# Cost Averaging & Liquidation Calculator - Test Validation

## Manual Calculation Tests

### Test Case 1: Basic Liquidation Calculation (Long Position)

**Input:**
- Position Size: $1,000
- Entry Price: $4,500
- Leverage: 25x
- Direction: Long

**Expected Calculations:**
```
Collateral = Size / Leverage = $1,000 / 25 = $40
Liquidation Factor = (1 / 25) × 0.9 = 0.04 × 0.9 = 0.036
Liquidation Price = $4,500 × (1 - 0.036) = $4,500 × 0.964 = $4,338
```

**Code Logic:**
```typescript
const leverage = 25;
const entryPrice = 4500;
const liquidationFactor = (1 / leverage) * 0.9; // 0.036
const liquidationPrice = entryPrice * (1 - liquidationFactor); // 4338
```

✅ **Expected Result:** Liquidation at $4,338

### Test Case 2: Basic Liquidation Calculation (Short Position)

**Input:**
- Position Size: $1,000
- Entry Price: $4,500
- Leverage: 25x
- Direction: Short

**Expected Calculations:**
```
Collateral = $1,000 / 25 = $40
Liquidation Factor = (1 / 25) × 0.9 = 0.036
Liquidation Price = $4,500 × (1 + 0.036) = $4,500 × 1.036 = $4,662
```

✅ **Expected Result:** Liquidation at $4,662

---

### Test Case 3: Cost Averaging with Single Order (Long)

**Current Position:**
- Size: $1,000
- Entry: $4,500
- Leverage: 25x
- Collateral: $40

**Pending Order:**
- Size: $500
- Price: $4,100
- Leverage: 25x
- Additional Collateral: $500 / 25 = $20

**Expected Calculations:**
```
New Total Size = $1,000 + $500 = $1,500
New Total Collateral = $40 + $20 = $60
Weighted Entry = ($1,000 × $4,500 + $500 × $4,100) / $1,500
               = ($4,500,000 + $2,050,000) / $1,500
               = $6,550,000 / $1,500
               = $4,366.67

New Leverage = $1,500 / $60 = 25x
New Liq Factor = (1 / 25) × 0.9 = 0.036
New Liquidation = $4,366.67 × (1 - 0.036) = $4,366.67 × 0.964 = $4,209.47
```

**Liquidation Improvement:**
```
Old Liquidation: $4,338
New Liquidation: $4,209.47
Change: $4,209.47 - $4,338 = -$128.53 (improved by moving down)
Change %: (-$128.53 / $4,338) × 100 = -2.96%
```

✅ **Expected Results:**
- New Average Entry: $4,366.67
- New Liquidation: $4,209.47
- Liquidation improved: Yes (✅ moved down for long)

---

### Test Case 4: Multiple Orders Cost Averaging

**Current Position:**
- Size: $1,000
- Entry: $4,500
- Leverage: 25x

**Pending Orders:**
1. $500 at $4,100 (25x)
2. $300 at $4,000 (25x)
3. $200 at $3,900 (25x)

**Expected Calculations:**
```
Total Size = $1,000 + $500 + $300 + $200 = $2,000
Total Collateral = $40 + $20 + $12 + $8 = $80

Weighted Entry = ($1,000×$4,500 + $500×$4,100 + $300×$4,000 + $200×$3,900) / $2,000
               = ($4,500,000 + $2,050,000 + $1,200,000 + $780,000) / $2,000
               = $8,530,000 / $2,000
               = $4,265

New Leverage = $2,000 / $80 = 25x
New Liquidation = $4,265 × 0.964 = $4,111.46

Improvement = $4,111.46 - $4,338 = -$226.54 (-5.22%)
```

✅ **Expected Results:**
- New Average Entry: $4,265
- New Liquidation: $4,111.46
- Improvement: 5.22% safer

---

### Test Case 5: High Leverage Position (100x)

**Input:**
- Size: $10,000
- Entry: $3,000
- Leverage: 100x
- Direction: Long

**Expected Calculations:**
```
Collateral = $10,000 / 100 = $100
Liquidation Factor = (1 / 100) × 0.9 = 0.009
Liquidation Price = $3,000 × (1 - 0.009) = $3,000 × 0.991 = $2,973
```

**Risk Analysis:**
- Distance to liquidation: $3,000 - $2,973 = $27 (0.9%)
- Very risky position!

✅ **Expected Result:** Liquidation at $2,973 (only $27 buffer)

---

### Test Case 6: Variable Leverage Orders

**Current Position:**
- Size: $1,000
- Entry: $5,000
- Leverage: 10x
- Collateral: $100

**Pending Order:**
- Size: $2,000
- Price: $4,500
- Leverage: 50x (different leverage!)
- Additional Collateral: $2,000 / 50 = $40

**Expected Calculations:**
```
New Size = $3,000
New Collateral = $100 + $40 = $140
New Average Entry = ($1,000×$5,000 + $2,000×$4,500) / $3,000
                  = ($5,000,000 + $9,000,000) / $3,000
                  = $4,666.67

New Leverage = $3,000 / $140 = 21.43x (blended)
New Liq Factor = (1 / 21.43) × 0.9 = 0.042
New Liquidation = $4,666.67 × (1 - 0.042) = $4,666.67 × 0.958 = $4,470.67
```

✅ **Expected Results:**
- Blended leverage: 21.43x
- New liquidation: $4,470.67

---

### Test Case 7: Edge Case - Zero Leverage

**Input:**
- Size: $1,000
- Entry: $4,000
- Leverage: 0 (or very close)

**Expected Behavior:**
```
liquidationFactor = (1 / 0) × 0.9 = Infinity
```

**Code Protection:**
```typescript
const liquidationFactor = leverage > 0 ? (1 / leverage) * 0.9 : 0;
```

✅ **Expected Result:** Handle gracefully with factor = 0

---

### Test Case 8: PnL Calculation (Long Profit)

**Position:**
- Size: $1,000
- Entry: $4,000
- Current Price: $4,500
- Direction: Long

**Expected PnL:**
```
Position in tokens = $1,000 / $4,000 = 0.25 tokens
PnL = (Current Price - Entry) × Tokens
    = ($4,500 - $4,000) × 0.25
    = $500 × 0.25
    = $125

Or simplified:
PnL = (markPrice - entryPrice) × (sizeUsd / entryPrice)
    = ($4,500 - $4,000) × ($1,000 / $4,000)
    = $500 × 0.25
    = $125
```

✅ **Expected Result:** $125 profit

---

### Test Case 9: PnL Calculation (Short Loss)

**Position:**
- Size: $1,000
- Entry: $4,000
- Current Price: $4,500
- Direction: Short

**Expected PnL:**
```
PnL = (entryPrice - markPrice) × (sizeUsd / entryPrice)
    = ($4,000 - $4,500) × ($1,000 / $4,000)
    = -$500 × 0.25
    = -$125
```

✅ **Expected Result:** -$125 loss

## Browser Console Tests

### 1. Check for Runtime Errors
```javascript
// Open DevTools Console (F12)
// Look for any red errors after:
- Page load
- Wallet connection
- Position fetch
- Order preview
```

### 2. Verify Position Data
```javascript
// After connecting wallet with active position, check:
// The analytics component should log position data
```

### 3. Test Calculations Manually
```javascript
// Example position
const position = {
  sizeUsd: 1000,
  collateralUsd: 40,
  entryPrice: 4500,
  direction: 'long'
};

const leverage = position.sizeUsd / position.collateralUsd; // 25
const liqFactor = (1 / leverage) * 0.9; // 0.036
const liqPrice = position.entryPrice * (1 - liqFactor); // 4338

console.log('Leverage:', leverage); // Should be 25
console.log('Liquidation:', liqPrice); // Should be 4338
```

## Known Limitations (Documented)

1. **Execution Fees**: Not included in predictions (~0.001 ETH per order)
2. **Borrowing Fees**: Accrued fees not included
3. **Price Impact**: Large orders may slip
4. **Partial Fills**: Assumes complete execution
5. **Oracle Delays**: Uses current oracle prices
